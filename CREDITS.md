### Special Thanks
A heartfelt thank you to the open-source community and all the maintainers of these projects. Your dedication to creating accessible, well-documented tools makes development a joy and enables projects like this to exist.
### AI Assistance
I'd also like to acknowledge the role of AI in my learning journey. While I'm still at an early stage of development, AI tools have been instrumental in helping me understand complex concepts, debug issues, and learn new technologies. Without AI assistance, creating an app of this scale would have been impossible for me at this stage of my learning. This project represents not just my coding skills, but also the collaborative potential between human developers and AI tools.
